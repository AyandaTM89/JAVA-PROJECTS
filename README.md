Capstone Java Projects


SQL CAPSTONE 


● Design a class called Course. The class should contain:
○ The data fields courseName (String), numberOfStudents (int) and
courseLecturer (String).
○ A constructor that constructs a Course object with the specified
courseName, numberOfStudents and courseLecturer.
○ The relevant get and set methods for the data fields.
○ A toString() method that formats that returns a string that
represents a course object in the following format:
(courseName, courseLecturer, numberOfStudents)
● Create a new ArrayList called courses1, add 5 courses to it and print it out.
● Sort the List according to the numberOfStudents and print it out.
● Swap the element at position 1 of the List with the element at position 2
and print it out.
● Create a new ArrayList called courses2.
● Using the addAll method add 5 courses to the courses2 List and print it
out.
● Copy all of the courses from courses1 into courses2.
● Add the following two elements to courses2:
○ (Java 101, Dr. P Green, 55)
○ (Advanced Programming, Prof. M Milton, 93)
● Sort the courses in courses2 alphabetically according to the course name
and print it out.
● Search for the course “Java 101” in courses2 and print out the index of the
course in the List.
● Use the disjoint function to determine whether courses1 and courses2
have any elements in common and print out the result.

● In courses2, find the course with the most students and the course with
the least students and print each out.

● Create a Java file called chores.java. Inside, write a Java lot-drawing
program that allows the user to enter a list of names and a list of chores
(equal lengths).
● The program should assign each person a random chore.
● Print out the pairs (i.e. name + chore)
